# Automated-ETL-Pipeline-for-Consumer-Financial-Complaints-Analysis
## Project Overview
This project automates an ETL pipeline using Python. Data is first profiled (reviewed and cleansed) before being loaded into Cloud SQL. Cloud Composer, managing Apache Airflow on GCP, orchestrates the pipeline to transform the data from Cloud SQL and load it into BigQuery. Finally, Looker Studio visualizes the data.
